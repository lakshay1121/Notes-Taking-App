# Notes-Taking-App


I have made this NOTES TAKING APP  by using HTML , for the structure of the webpage  and used BOOTSTRAP for the box contents we can also use CSS3 but i usually prefer BOOTSTRAP because we don't have to write the full HTML and CSS code , and for the logic part i have used JAVASCRIPT .
